# About Me
My name is Mike Wood. I'm ab Assistant Professor at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories (MLML) and in the Department of Computer Science at San Jos√© State University. At MLML, I am starting up the Computational Oceanography lab where we will use models and satellite data to understand our ocean and how it is responding to our changing climate. While I am interested in processes all over our global ocean, I am especially interested in how the oceans interact with glaciers, leading to sea level rise. 

I am constantly learning, improving, and looking to share new code with anyone looking to collaborate on similar topics. If you have any recommendations for these projects, please feel free to fork one of my repos and/or submit a pull request. My repositories span my personal and professional interests, and can be organized into the following subgroups:

Note, I am in the process of making these repositories public.
